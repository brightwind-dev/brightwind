    "Before starting these tutorials, ideally the user should have a background in wind data analysis or wind resource assessment. No prior knowledge of the python programming language is necessary, but is preferable. EdX have a nice [introductory course to python and pandas dataframes](https://www.edx.org/course/python-for-data-science-2) which will give you a good grounding of some basic python concepts for data science aswell as pandas dataframes which are used extensively by the library.\n",

We will use the `OrdinaryLeastSquares()` function to carry out a ordinary least squares linear regression correlation. We will then show how this can be run in a loop for various reference datasets and time periods. We will also touch on other correlation methods in the library such as `OrthogonalLeastSquares()`, `MultipleLinearRegression()`, `Speedsort()`, `SVR()` and the `SimpleSpeedRatio()`. "
